<title>SQLite4</title>

<h1>This Is Probably Not The Project You Are Looking For</h1>

<p>SQLite4 was an experimental rewrite of SQLite that was active from
2012 through 2014.  <em>All development work on SQLite4 has ended.</em>
Lessons learned from SQLite4 have been folded into the main
[https://sqlite.org/|SQLite3] product.  SQLite4 was never released.
There are no plans to revive it.  You should be using
[https://sqlite.org/|SQLite3].

<p>This repository preserves the history of the SQLite4 experiment as
an historical artifact.  The code found here is non-functional and is
not maintained.
